    <div class="container">
        <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="title col-md-12 col-lg-10">
                <h3 class="mbr-section-title mbr-fonts-style align-center mb-4 display-2"><strong>A healthy diet should include these high-protein, low-fat foods</strong></h3>
                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">We must take in high-protein foods to stay healthy. Protein is an essential part of any balanced diet and functions to repair worn-out tissues and build the body while also maintaining the normal functionality of the body’s systems. But what happens when the high-protein foods around us also contain too much fat and calories than we need? This would mean that we have to choose.
<div>
</div><div>Here are a number of high-protein and low-fat foods for a healthy diet.
</div><div>
</div><div>1. Plain Yogurt (Greek Yogurt)
</div><div>In contrast to normal yogurt, plain or Greek yogurt is made by removing liquid whey during processing. What this does is that it produces a much more protein-rich kind of yogurt with less fat and a more creamy texture. If you are looking for high-protein and low-fat food, then this is a good pick.
</div><div>
</div><div>It’s safe to say that 170 grams of Greek yogurt contain approximately 20 grams of protein.[1] You can have a Greek yogurt drink alongside a low-calorie snack like cheese or eggs. The good news is that you can even consider it a late-night snack because of the tryptophan it contains as tryptophan helps improve sleep quality.
</div><div>
</div><div>2. White-Meat Poultry
</div><div>White meat does not only taste good, but it contains a remarkable amount of essential proteins, too. On average, 100-grams of boiled or roasted turkey contains approximately around 30 grams of protein—that much!</div><div>
</div><div>Most of the protein content in white meat is concentrated around the breasts and wings. This means that chicken or turkey breasts contain less fat than the other parts, such as the legs, thighs, etc would contain.
</div><div>
</div><div>Even the skin of poultry contains more fat than the breasts! For a high-protein, low-fat food, you can have poultry meat stripped of skin.
</div><div>
</div><div>3. Egg Whites
</div><div>More than half of the protein content of regular eggs is present in these eggs as the egg white. Agreed, the yolk contains a list of other great nutrients like cholesterol, but it also contains a large amount of fat and calories.
</div><div>
</div><div>If you are seeking to pick a meal with little fat but high protein content, then we advise you to stick to eating just egg whites. Egg whites contain more protein and less fat than the yolk.</div><div>
</div><div>Like yogurt, they can also be a great choice for late-night snacks as their protein content can improve the quality of your sleep.
</div><div>
</div><div>4. Milk
</div><div>Milk contains a variety of nutrients in the right proportion, and it is a great pick if you are seeking high-protein low-fat foods. Some of the nutrients in milk are calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin B12.
</div><div>
</div><div>Low-fat milk can be obtained as skimmed or dry milk. It tastes good and is good for you. Calcium is great for your bones and so are the other nutrients milk contains.
</div><div>
</div><div>Please note, however, that milk might not be so great a pick for you if you suffer lactose intolerance as it can trigger diarrhea and gas.
</div><div>
</div><div>5. Tuna Fish
</div><div>Tuna is a healthy protein meal, anytime, any day. It is a fish found in saltwater. Its flesh yields high protein and little fat and calories. It also yields vitamins and some other great nutrients like Omega-3 fatty acids that act as antioxidants.
</div><div>
</div><div>Want To Boost Your Brain Power And Energy?
</div><div>Omega 3 is critical to brain function as well as our overall well-being, but our body cannot produce it on it's own at significant levels. Consume this from a good Omega 3 Fish Oil Supplement!
</div><div>
</div><div>Learn About Fish Oil Supplement
</div><div>
</div><div>Tuna can be boiled and eaten hot or taken in combination with a variety of vegetables and—to some people—even cheese. It tastes good and is great for you even as a late-night snack. However, eating fried tuna fish isn’t so great because oil contains a lot of calories.
</div><div>
</div><div>6. Shrimp
</div><div>Shrimps are great seafood. They look like craw fish but are a bit larger. A great pick for a low-fat, high-protein diet, shrimps contain high contents of other nutrients such as Selenium and Riboflavin. Like most fatty acids, it contains Omega-3 fatty acids.
</div><div>
</div><div>The calories in shrimp are so low that about 3-ounces of shrimp contains about 20 grams of protein but barely 84 calories.</div><div>
</div><div>Some people show allergic reactions after taking in seafood. This is due to underlying allergies, a situation where the body considers some compounds in seafood as antigens and attempts to fight against them. If you show allergic reactions after eating seafood, then you might want to refrain from taking them.
</div><div>
</div><div>7. Bison
</div><div>Bison, known by some as Buffalo, is considered more healthy and relatively fat-free compared to beef. It is believed that beef has almost double the amount of fat as does bison per ounce.</div><div>
</div><div>Bison contains a lot of other nutrients and in larger quantities than beef. It also contains Omega-3 fatty acids and ALA.
</div><div>
</div><div>Yes, Bison is not red meat, and red meat is mostly not advisable. But compared to beef, it is considered leaner meat and passes as a high-protein, low-fat food.
</div><div>
</div><div>8. Low-Fat Cottage Cheese
</div><div>Cottage cheese is a protein-rich food. And even better, it contains low fat and calories. It tastes good and kids love it.
</div><div>
</div><div>Cheese contains calcium, which is great for the development of bones and strong teeth. Most manufacturers even add Vitamin D, which helps your body absorb and make use of its calcium and is great for the parathyroid glands.
</div><div>
</div><div>Cottage cheese can be flavored to suit demands. It goes along with other low-fat drinks and is a great late-night snack. Taking some cheese with Greek yogurt just before bed is great!
</div><div>
</div><div>9. White-Fleshed Fish
</div><div>White-fleshed fish are high protein-yielding meals and contain very little fat. 100 grams of plainly cooked white-fleshed fish should contain around 25 grams of protein and roughly 120 calories.[6]
</div><div>
</div><div>White-fleshed fish contains anti-inflammatory fatty acids, such as ALA and Omega-3 fatty acids. They include tilapia fish, Pollock, flounder, haddock, etc.
</div><div>
</div><div>If you live in a rive rain area, it might be easy to get white-fleshed fish as they are most probably sold in beach markets. But if you don’t, you can get white-fleshed fish in marts and stores. You’d get them as frozen food.
</div><div>

</div><div>Turmeric may just be what you need to reduce your inflammation and boost your energy again.
</div><div>
</div><div>10. Legumes
</div><div>Legumes are a group of plants in the family Fabaceae. A subgroup of legumes called pulses is a great source of protein and fiber yet contains low fat and calories. Pulses include beans, peas, and lentils. 100 grams of pulses are believed to average 8 grams of protein and a low percentage of calories compared to other foods.
</div><div>
</div><div>Fibers contained in pulses and a variety of other foods are known to have an effect in lowering blood pressure and may help one pass out stool better. Fibers also aid digestive functions and defecation. Legumes can also be considered a healthy late-night meal.
</div><div>
</div><div>11. Tofu
</div><div>Tofu is made from soybean and is a constituent of most vegetarian meals. It yields a high content of protein, and plant-based protein is rich in essential amino acids.
</div><div>
</div><div>Tofu also contains flavorless. These antioxidants, flavorless, are great at helping against heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and immune system disorders.
</div><div>
</div><div>Vegetarians can substitute meat with Tofu. It even has that stringy texture meat gives. So yes, it’s a great substitute! Tofu is also a great source of vitamins, as are other plant products.
</div><div>
</div><div>12. Liver
</div><div>Liver is one of the most nutritious foods there is. The variety of nutrients it contains is vast. It contains folate, which is a B-vitamin and is needed to produce red and white blood cells in the body.
</div><div>
</div><div>Liver contains Vitamin B, also known as riboflavin, which is essential to promote normal bodily functions, as well as iron, which is a major constituent of hemoglobin in red blood cells. It also contains copper, which is essential for thyroid function.
</div><div>
</div><div>Although liver contains some amount of cholesterol and high calories, its high-protein and nutrient content makes up for this.
</div><div>
</div><div>13. Guava
</div><div>Guava yields a lot of protein and fibers. Still, it has few calories and so, would pass as a great pick for a low-fat, high-protein diet. It also contains almost thrice the number of vitamins contained in five medium oranges.
</div><div>
</div><div>Guava tastes good and can serve a variety of functions. It can be blended into a smoothie and taken alongside cheese, or you can just eat it the way it is.
</div><div>
</div><div>Summary
</div><div>Low-fat, high-protein meals are great therapy for weight loss. Fat is known to cause health concerns when taken in excess. It could cause belly fat, weight gain, and even heart problems. This is why we are advised to stick to low-fat meals.
</div><div>
</div><div>Proteins foods, most of the time, are great low-fat meals, delivering a high content of protein and at the same time a low content of fatty acids and cholesterol.
</div><div>
</div><div>When choosing low-calorie, high-protein foods, fish, white poultry, etc, are a great pick. Remember to always eat healthily.</div></h4>
